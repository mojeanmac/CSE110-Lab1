## Intro
Hi, I'm **Molly**! I am a second year computer engineering major in the ECE department at *UC San Diego.* I enjoy long walks on the beach and late nights in the CSE basement. Check out my [main website](https://mojeanmac.github.io/).

## My Interests
### A few things I like are:
- social computing
- cybersecurity
- rock climbing
- petting cats

## Code that I like
**Code Golfing** is a fun challenge that involves writing the shortest possible code to solve a certain problem. For example, here is a program to play rock paper scissors against the computer using Python 3's default hash randomization in *55 bytes*:
```
q={*'rps'}.pop()
print(q,'rrppssrpsr'.count(q+input()))
```
